Project SHADOW - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Intelligence Retrieval
Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to simulate a real-world intelligence retrieval assistant. It is built to retrieve relevant classified information based on a query and an agent's clearance level. The system leverages vector embeddings and graph-based retrieval to generate responses from two key knowledge sources:

Secret Info Manual: Contains highly classified intelligence data.

Response Framework: Provides response protocols based on agent level and query type.

The system incorporates security protocols to ensure that agents can only access information within their clearance level. The solution is designed to adapt responses based on the agent’s level, offering tailored information, from basic guidance to cryptic, high-level strategies.

Features
Retrieval Mechanism: Uses vector similarity (via embeddings) and graph-based retrieval to fetch relevant information.

Security Protocols: Enforces agent-level clearance and blocks access to sensitive data above an agent's clearance.

Dynamic Responses: Generates agent-specific responses based on their level (from Level 1 to Level 5).

Modular: Easy to scale with new protocols, data sources, or retrieval mechanisms.

Technologies Used
Python 3

FAISS: For fast vector-based search.

Sentence Transformers: For embedding text chunks.

NetworkX: For graph-based retrieval.

python-docx: For reading .docx files (Secret Info Manual and Response Framework).

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-shadow
Install dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the notebook file shadow_retriever.ipynb in Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook shadow_retriever.ipynb
Query the system:

Select the agent level (Level 1 to Level 5).

Input a classified query.

The system will retrieve relevant information and generate a response based on the agent’s clearance.

Explanation of the System
The system is based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model:

Document Chunking: The documents (SECRET INFO MANUAL and RAG CASE RESPONSE FRAMEWORK) are split into manageable chunks to facilitate fast and relevant retrieval.

Vector Embeddings: Text chunks are converted into embeddings using Sentence Transformers. These embeddings are stored in FAISS for quick similarity search.

Security Handling: The system checks the agent’s clearance level before allowing access to sensitive data. If an agent's clearance level is insufficient, the system returns: "Access Denied - Clearance Insufficient."

Response Generation: Based on the retrieved data, the system generates responses, which vary based on the agent’s level (from Level 1 to Level 5). For instance:

Level 1 agents receive basic and instructional responses.

Level 5 agents get cryptic and high-level strategic advice.

Security Protocols
Clearance Level Check: Ensures that agents only access information they are authorized to view.

Sensitive Data Retrieval: Ensures that level 7 or higher data is only accessed by agents with the correct clearance.

Access Control: If a query doesn’t match any data, the system returns: "Oops !! No matching data found."

Future Improvements
Advanced Chunking & Storage: Optimizing the document chunking process for faster retrieval in larger datasets.

Modular Pipeline: Extending the system to handle additional knowledge sources and security protocols.
